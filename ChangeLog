        * Version 0.6.2.   Converted from PostgreSQL 7.3 protocol
        to PostgreSQL 7.4 protocol.  Version 0.6.2 is *not*
        compatible with the libraries or tools of PostgreSQL 7.3.
        Changes include removing the BEGIN and COMMIT commands
        and removing the pg_user table since these are no longer
        required for connection set up.  The function command is
        also removed.
           dbcommand() now return RTA_NOBUF if there insufficient
        room in the output buffer for even an error message.

        * Version 0.6.0.   Added virtual file system interface using
        the fuse package by Miklos Szeredi.  The library librtafs.a
        adds two API routines, rtafs_init() and do_rtafs(), which
        mount and maintain the program's tables as files in a file
        system.
           This version also fixes a memory leak which occurred when
        the Yacc parser detected an SQL syntax error.  The amount of
        leaked memory was about equal to the lenghts of the table and
        columns names in the query.

        * Version 0.5.1.   Added BEGIN and COMMIT to the SQL commands
        recognized in order to allow login from Posgres 7.3.X clients.
        The 7.3 Postgres login uses a transaction as part of the login.
        The commands, while not causing an error, DO NOTHING.  There
        is no attempt in the code to implement transactions.
