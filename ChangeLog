        * Version 0.6.0.   Added virtual file system interface using
        the fuse package by Miklos Szeredi.  The library librtafs.a
        adds two API routines, rtafs_init() and do_rtafs(), which
        mount and maintain the program's tables as files in a file
        system.
           This version also fixes a memory leak which occurred when
        the Yacc parser detected an SQL syntax error.  The amount of
        leaked memory was about equal to the lenghts of the table and
        columns names in the query.

        * Version 0.5.1.   Added BEGIN and COMMIT to the SQL commands
        recognized in order to allow login from Posgres 7.3.X clients.
        The 7.3 Postgres login uses a transaction as part of the login.
        The commands, while not causing an error, DO NOTHING.  There
        is no attempt in the code to implement transactions.
