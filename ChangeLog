        * Version 0.5.1.   Added BEGIN and COMMIT to the SQL commands
        recognized in order to allow login from Posgres 7.3.X clients.
        The 7.3 Postgres login uses a transaction as part of the login.
        The commands, while not causing an error, DO NOTHING.  There
        is no attempt in the code to implement transactions.
