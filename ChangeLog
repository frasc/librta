2004-03-07 Bob Smith                              Version 0.7.2. 
    - Added a prototype deamon based on RTA.  The daemon is
      called 'empty deamon' or empd.  This addition prompted
      the addition of rta_config_dir below.
    - Fixed a bug in the iterator for the rta_tables table.
    - Fixed various typo and spelling errors.
    - Added the 'rta_config_dir' to specify a directory to be
      prepended to table savefile names.  If the savefile uses 
      an absolute path (starting with '/') it is not prepended 
      with the configuration directory.
    - Added checks to prevent the use of our reserved SQL words
      as either a table name or as a column name.  Reserved words
      are: SELECT, UPDATE, FROM, WHERE, LIMIT, OFFSET, and SET.
      (The words are reserved in both upper and lower case.)
      Changed the column name 'offset' in rta_columns to 'noff'.


2004-02-26 Bob Smith                              Version 0.7.1.
    - Replace "epg" with "rta" in all documents.
    - Verify that the name in a column definition matches the
      name of the table it is defined with.
    - Fixed a bug in which write callbacks were always passed
      a column name of NULL.
    - Removed rta_init() from API.  It is not needed and it's
      safer to do the init on the first call to rta_add_table().
    - Added another parameter to the write callback which points
      to a copy of the unmodified row.  The malloc(), memcpy(),
      and free() slows the system slightly but the ability to do
      edge detection is worth the extra CPU time.
    - The length of a string field now includes space for a
      null at the end of the string.  This bug could be a source
      of a buffer overflow.
    - Fixed a bug in selecting which columns to save to disk
      for non-volatile tables.


2004-01-03 Bob Smith                              Version 0.7.0.
    - Added a callback function, called an 'iterator', which
      advances a row pointer from one row to the next.  This
      makes it possible to have linked-lists appear as tables
      in Run Time Access.   Previous versions required that all
      data be arranged as an array of struct.
    - Minor bug fix in the table save function.
    - Rolled shared object version to '.2'.
    - Modified the table read and write callbacks to add an
      additional parameter.  Be sure to update your callbacks.


2003-12-16 Bob Smith                              Version 0.6.2.
    - Converted from PostgreSQL 7.3 protocol to PostgreSQL 7.4
      protocol.  Version 0.6.2 is *not* compatible with the
      libraries or tools of PostgreSQL 7.3.  Changes include
      removing the BEGIN and COMMIT commands and removing the
      pg_user table since these are no longer required for
      connection set up.  The function command is also removed.
    - dbcommand() now return RTA_NOBUF if there insufficient
      room in the output buffer for even an error message.


2003-08-26  Bob Smith                             Version 0.6.1.
    - Change st_atim to st_atime in rtafs.c.


2003-08-22  Bob Smith                             Version 0.6.0.  
    - Added virtual file system interface using the fuse package
      by Miklos Szeredi.  The library librtafs.a adds two API
      routines, rtafs_init() and do_rtafs(), which mount and
      maintain the program's tables as files in a file system.
    - This version also fixes a memory leak which occurred when
      the Yacc parser detected an SQL syntax error.  The amount of
      leaked memory was about equal to the lengths of the table and
      columns names in the query.


2003-04-18  Bob Smith                             Version 0.5.1.
    - Added BEGIN and COMMIT to the SQL commands recognized in
      order to allow login from Posgres 7.3.X clients.  The 7.3
      Postgres login uses a transaction as part of the login.
      The commands, while not causing an error, DO NOTHING.  There
      is no attempt in the code to implement transactions.


2003-02-19  Bob Smith                             Version 0.5.0.
    - Initial release.
