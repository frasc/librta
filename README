RTA gives you run time access to the data in your program.
It is intended for embedded system developers and can 
greatly simplify user-interface programs by separating the
daemon proper from the UI programs.

It is a specialized memory resident database interface
and/or virtual file system interface.  It is not a 
stand-alone server but a library which attaches to your
program and offers up your program's internal structures
and arrays as data base tables or as files in a file 
system.  It uses a subset of the Postgres protocol and is
compatible with the Postgres bindings for "C", PHP, and
the Postgres command line tool, psql.

The most recent release adds the ability to access your
internal tables as files in a virtual file system.  This
ability gives your programs the same power /proc gives 
the kernel.
