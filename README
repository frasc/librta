LIBRTA gives you run time access to the data in your program.
It is intended for embedded system developers and can 
greatly simplify user-interface programs by separating the
daemon proper from the UI programs.

LIBRTA is not a stand-alone database server, but a library
which you build into your program and to make your program's
internal arrays and data structures look like tables in a
database.  It uses a subset of the Postgres protocol and is
compatible with the Postgres bindings for "C", PHP, and
the Postgres command line tool, psql.

This release is compatible with the PostgreSQL 8.1, 8.0, and
7.4 protocols.  It is *not* compatible with the earlier 7.3
and 7.2 protocols.

Please see http://www.librta.org for more
information and a working example.
