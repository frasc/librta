"rta" gives you run time access to the data in your program.

It is a specialized memory resident data base interface.
It is not a stand-alone server but a library which attaches
to your program and offers up your program's internal
structures and arrays as data base tables. It uses a subset
of the Postgres protocol and is compatible with the Postgres
bindings for "C", PHP, and the Postgres command line tool,
psql.

For comparison: /proc is to the kernel is to a filesystem
as rta is to your_program is to a Postgres data base.

It is intended for embedded system developers and can 
greatly simplify user-interface programs by separating the
service from the UI programs.
