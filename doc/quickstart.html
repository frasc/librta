 <h2>Quick Start</h2> 
<p>This page give a brief tutorial on the use of the rta package by
building a trivial application which uses rta. We define the task,
define the tables, give the code, and describe how to build and
link the application. The last section describes how to the test
the application.</p>

<h3><a name="app">Problem Statement</a></h3>
<p>We want to build an application called "myapp" in which we expose
an internal array of data structures to a PHP-based user interface
program. The array has twenty structures and each structure has a
writeable integer, a writeable float, a writeable string, and a
read-only string. Both strings are thirty characters in length. A
call back on the writeable string does two things: it replaces any
'&lt;' and '&gt;' characters with a '.', and it copies the reversed
string into the the read-only string.</p>
<p>The structure would be defined as:</p>
<pre>
#define NOTE_LEN   30
struct MyData {
    int    myint;
    float  myfloat;
    char   notes[NOTE_LEN];
    char   seton[NOTE_LEN];
};
</pre>
<p>We allocate storage for the data as:</p>
<pre>
#define ROW_COUNT  20
struct MyData mydata[ROW_COUNT];
</pre>
<p>Externally, we want this array of structures to be seen as a
Postgres table called "mytable".</p>
<br> 
<h3><a name="tbl">Table Definitions</a></h3>
<p>We need to tell the rta package about our table. To do this we need
to build a COLDEF structure for each of the four columns, and we to
build a TBLDEF structure for "mydata", the array of structures.</p>
<p>We use an array of four COLDEFs to describe our columns. This is
pretty simple:</p>
<pre>
COLDEF mycolumns[] = {
  {
    "mytable",          /* the table name */
    "myint",            /* the column name */
    RTA_INT,            /* it is an integer */
    sizeof(int),        /* number of bytes */
    offsetof(struct MyData, myint), /* location in struct */
    0,                  /* no flags */
    (void (*)()) 0,     /* called before read */
    (void (*)()) 0,     /* called after write */
    "A sample integer in a table"
  },
  {
    "mytable",          /* the table name */
    "myfloat",          /* the column name */
    RTA_FLOAT,          /* it is a float */
    sizeof(float),      /* number of bytes */
    offsetof(struct MyData, myfloat), /* location in struct */
    0,                  /* no flags */
    (void (*)()) 0,     /* called before read */
    (void (*)()) 0,     /* called after write */
    "A sample float in a table"
  },
  {
    "mytable",          /* the table name */
    "notes",            /* the column name */
    RTA_STR,            /* it is an integer */
    NOTE_LEN,           /* number of bytes */
    offsetof(struct MyData, notes), /* location in struct */
    0,                  /* no flags */
    (void (*)()) 0,     /* called before read */
    reverse_str,        /* called after write */
    "A sample note string in a table"
  },
  {
    "mytable",          /* the table name */
    "seton",            /* the column name */
    RTA_STR,            /* it is an integer */
    NOTE_LEN,           /* number of bytes */
    offsetof(struct MyData, seton), /* location in struct */
    RTA_READONLY,       /* a read-only column */
    (void (*)()) 0,     /* called before read */
    (void (*)()) 0,     /* called after write */
    "Another sample note string in a table"
  },
};
</pre>
<br>
<br>

<p>For each of the four structure elements we gave the associated
table name, column name, type, size, position in the struct, flags,
read and write callbacks, and a short string to describe it.</p>
<p>We define the table in a similar way:</p>
<pre>
TBLDEF mytbldef {
    "mytable",           /* table name */
    mydata,              /* address of table */
    sizeof(struct mydata), /* length of each row */
    ROW_COUNT,           /* number of rows */
    mycolumns,           /* array of column defs */
    sizeof(mycolumns) / sizeof(COLDEF),
                         /* the number of columns */
    "",                  /* no save file */
    "A sample table"
};
</pre>
<p>Note the double quotes to specify no save file. This field is a
pointer-to-string and the pointer can not be null, although the
string can be. </p>
<br>
 
<h3><a name="code">C Code</a></h3>
<p>The source code for our simple application is available here as
<a href="myapp.c">myapp.c</a>. The first section of code of note is
the list of include files:</p>
<pre>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;stddef.h&gt;             /* for 'offsetof' */
#include &lt;string.h&gt;             /* for 'strlen' */
#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;             /* for 'read/write/close' */
#include &lt;sys/socket.h&gt;
#include &lt;netinet/in.h&gt;
#include "../src/rta.h"
</pre>
<p>You will need to set the path to the rta.h file to reflect where
you install it. </p>
<p>We have already presented the code for the structures and arrays
of structures. Let's look at the code in the main() program to
perform all initialization:</p>
<pre>
int main()
{
    int   i;                   /* a loop counter */
    int   srvfd;               /* FD for our server socket */
    int   connfd;              /* FD for conn to client */
    struct sockaddr_in srvskt; /* server listen socket */
    struct sockaddr_in cliskt; /* socket to the UI/DB client */
    int   adrlen;
    char  inbuf[INSZ];         /* Buffer for incoming SQL commands */
    char  outbuf[OUTSZ];       /* response back to the client */
    int   incnt;               /* SQL command input count */
    int   outcnt;              /* SQL command output count */
    int   dbret;               /* return value from SQL command */

    /* init mydata */
    for (i=0; i&lt;ROW_COUNT; i++) {
        mydata[i].myint    = 0;
        mydata[i].myfloat  = 0.0;
        mydata[i].notes[0] = (char) 0;
        mydata[i].seton[0] = (char) 0;
    }

    /* init the rta package and tell it about mydata */
    rta_init();
    if (rta_add_table(&amp;mytbldef) != RTA_SUCCESS) {
        fprintf(stderr, "Table definition error!\n");
        exit(1);
    }
 
</pre>
<p>This is pretty standard stuff. We allocate our socket structures
and other local variables. We initialize the rta package and add
our one table.</p>
<p>The last piece of initialization is to set up the socket to
listen for incoming client connections. Remember that each UI
program will treat our program as if it were a Postgres database.
We have to accept TCP connections from Postgres clients.</p>
<p>By-the-way: the following code is pretty horrendous. It uses
blocking IO, ignores error conditions, and makes wildly optimistic
assumptions about socket IO. My goal is to make the code
understandable by getting it into as few lines as possible.</p>
<pre>
    /* We now need to open a socket to listen for incoming
     * client connections. */
    adrlen = sizeof (struct sockaddr_in);
    (void) memset ((void *) &amp;srvskt, 0, (size_t) adrlen);
    srvskt.sin_family = AF_INET;
    srvskt.sin_addr.s_addr = INADDR_ANY;
    srvskt.sin_port = htons (8888);
    srvfd = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0); /* no error checks! */
    bind(srvfd, (struct sockaddr *) &amp;srvskt, adrlen);
    listen (srvfd, 4);
</pre>
<p>The main loop in our program waits for a TCP connection from a
client, then loops reading the Postgres encoded stream of SQL
commands, processing them with dbcommand(), and then writing any
results back to the client. While a connection can close for
errors, we normally expect the client to request an orderly close
to the connection.:</p>
<pre>
    /* Loop forever accepting client connections */
    while (1) {
        connfd = accept(srvfd, (struct sockaddr *) &amp;cliskt, &amp;adrlen);
        if (connfd &lt; 0) {
            fprintf(stderr, "Error on socket/bind/listen/accept\n");
            exit(1);
        }
        incnt = 0;
        while (connfd &gt;= 0) {
            incnt = read(connfd, &amp;inbuf[incnt], INSZ-incnt);
            if (incnt &lt;= 0) {
                close(connfd);
                connfd = -1;
            }
            outcnt = OUTSZ;
            dbret = dbcommand(inbuf, &amp;incnt, outbuf, &amp;outcnt);
            switch (dbret) {
                case RTA_SUCCESS:
                    write(connfd, outbuf, (OUTSZ - outcnt));
                    incnt = 0;
                    break;
                case RTA_NOCMD:
                    break;
                case RTA_CLOSE:
                    close(connfd);
                    connfd = -1;
                    break;
            }
        }
    }
</pre>
<p>The callback function is fairly straightforward. Remember that
the write callback is called on a column after the write of all
update data to the columns. Our write callback on the 'notes' field
is called after the data has been written. It loops through the
string replacing greater-than and less-than symbols with a period,
and coping a reverse of the string into the 'seton' field.</p>
<pre>
void reverse_str(char *tbl, char *col, char *sql, int rowid)
{
    int   i,j;                 /* loop counters */

    i = strlen(mydata[rowid].notes) -1;  /* -1 to ignore NULL */
    for(j=0 ; i&gt;=0; i--,j++) {
        if (mydata[rowid].notes[i] == '&lt;' ||
            mydata[rowid].notes[i] == '&gt;')
            mydata[rowid].notes[i] = '.';
        mydata[rowid].seton[j] = mydata[rowid].notes[i];
    }
    mydata[rowid].seton[j] = (char) 0;
}
</pre>

<h3><a name="build">Build and Link</a></h3>
<p>
The information in this section should be sufficient
to download, build, and run the sample application.</p>
<p>Download the rta package from the download page 
given above.  Untar it.  Go to the src directory
and do a make.  </p>
<pre>
    tar -xzf rta-0.5.0.tgz
    cd rta-0.5.0
    cd src
    make
</pre>
<p>Download the myapp.c file (available 
<a href=myapp.c>here</a>).  Place the file
in the test directory.  Build it with the
command:
<pre>
  gcc myapp.c -o myapp -L../src -lrta
</pre></p>
<p>Note that we are telling the application that the
library it needs is in the sibling <tt>src</tt>
directory.</p>
<p>To run the application we will need to tell
it where to find the shared object library.  From
the <tt>test</tt> directory enter:</p>
<pre>
   export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=../src
   ./myapp &amp;
</pre>
<p>That is all there is to it.  Please use the contact
page to report any problems you find.  </p>

<br>
<h3><a name="test">Test</a></h3>
<p>If all has gone well, we now have an
application running which pretends to be a Postgres
data base server.  Only instead of a data base, it
is our sample application offering up its internal
tables for use by various Postgres clients.</p>
<h4>psql</h4>
<p>The first client to try is the Postgres browser
tool, psql.  This tool part of the base Postgres
install.  Remember that we have our application
table, mytable, as well as the rta internal tables,
rta_tables, rta_columns, pg_user, rta_dbg, and
rta_stat.  See the API section for a description
of these tables.</p>
<p>To start psql to our application enter:</p>
<pre>
    psql -h localhost -p 8888
</pre><p>Postgres should respond with:<p>
<pre>
    Welcome to psql, the PostgreSQL interactive terminal.

    Type:  \copyright for distribution terms
           \h for help with SQL commands
           \? for help on internal slash commands
           \g or terminate with semicolon to execute query
           \q to quit
</pre>
<p>Let's try some SQL commands to play with the tables.</p>
<p>Give me a list of the tables:</p>
<pre>
    SELECT name FROM rta_tables;
        name     
    -------------
     rta_tables
     rta_columns
     pg_user
     rta_dbg
     rta_stat
     mytable
    (6 rows)
</pre>
<p>You do not need to use upper case for the SQL keywords.
The psql program accepts both upper and lower case.</p>
<p>Display the contents of mytable:</p>
<pre>
    SELECT * FROM mytable;
     myint |       myfloat        | notes | seton 
    -------+----------------------+-------+-------
     0     |         0.0000000000 |       | 
     0     |         0.0000000000 |       | 
     0     |         0.0000000000 |       | 
     0     |         0.0000000000 |       | 
     0     |         0.0000000000 |       | 
     0     |         0.0000000000 |       | 
     0     |         0.0000000000 |       | 
     0     |         0.0000000000 |       | 
     0     |         0.0000000000 |       | 
     0     |         0.0000000000 |       | 
     0     |         0.0000000000 |       | 
     0     |         0.0000000000 |       | 
     0     |         0.0000000000 |       | 
     0     |         0.0000000000 |       | 
     0     |         0.0000000000 |       | 
     0     |         0.0000000000 |       | 
     0     |         0.0000000000 |       | 
     0     |         0.0000000000 |       | 
     0     |         0.0000000000 |       | 
     0     |         0.0000000000 |       | 
    (20 rows)
</pre>
<p>Set all of the myint values to 44 and display
the new table:</p>
<pre>
    UPDATE mytable SET myint=44;
    UPDATE 20
    SELECT * FROM mytable;
</pre>
<p>Note that psql tells us how many rows were modified.</p>
<p>Set the notes field to "hi mom!"</p>
<pre>
    UPDATE mytable SET notes="hi mom!";
    UPDATE 20
</pre>
<p>Set the notes field of only row 0 to "&lt;b&gt;hi mom!&lt;/b&gt;":</p>
<pre>
    UPDATE mytable SET notes="&lt;b&gt;hi mom!&lt;/b&gt;" LIMIT 1 OFFSET 0;
    UPDATE 1
</pre>
<p>The <tt>LIMIT</tt> says how many rows to change, and the
<tt>OFFSET</tt> tells where to start the changes.  The default
LIMIT is all rows, and the default OFFSET is zero.</p>
<p>Turn on the trace of all SQL commands and send the output to
both stderr and syslog:</p>
<pre>
    UPDATE rta_dbg SET trace=1, target=3;
</pre>
<p>You should now see all the commands echoed on the standard
error output of the program.  The commands are also being sent
to your syslog facility.</p>

<h4>C</h4>
<p>The C program presented here,<a href=rta_client.c> 
rta_client.c</a>, illustrates how to get data out of our
application from a C program.  You need the postgres-devel
package to build this program.  Build and run the program with:</p>
<pre>
    gcc rta_client.c -o rta_client -lpq
    ./rta_client
</pre>
<p>The program sets the field myint to a value of 44 and then gets
and prints the fields myint, myfloat, and notes for all twenty
rows in the table.</p>
<p>Note that we test for success in different ways depending
on whether or not we expect data back from the command.  Note also
that the returned data is always a string.  You need to scan it
into a variable for other processing.</p>

<h4>PHP</h4>
<p>The PHP program presented here,<a href=rta_client.txt> 
rta_client.php</a>, illustrates how to get data out of our
application from a PHP program.  You need the php-pgsql
package to run this program.  If you are running Apache, check
for the PHP interpreter in modules directory.  On RH8.0 look
for libphp4.so in /etc/httpd/modules.  You can verify that the
PHP-Postgres library is loaded by checking for pgsql.so in the
/usr/lib/php4 directory.  Clearly your configuration for PHP
and Postgres may be different than what is described here. </p>
<p>This program gets and displays the fields myint, myfloat,
and notes for all twenty rows in the table.</p>
<p>
Perhaps a better way to evaluate PHP is to install the
table editor which comes with the rta package.  Just put
the four .php files onto your web server (being sure that
PHP and php-pgsql are installed).  The table editor is the
application running on the <i>Live Demo</i> link above.
