Most recent Linux distributions are using PosgreSQL 7.3, so
you probably want rta-0.6.1.</p>
<p>Note also that the RTA file system interface uses the
Fuse-1.0 package not the newer Fuse-1.1 version.  This will
be fixed in a later release.

<td>2004-02-26<br>
        Replace "epg" with "rta" in all documents.
          Verify that the name in a column definition matches the
        name of the table it is defined with.
          Fixed a bug in which write callbacks were always passed
        a column name of NULL.
          Removed rta_init() from API.  It is not needed and it's
        safer to do the init on the first call to rta_add_table().
          The length of RTA strings now includes the terminating
        null.  Previously all characters in the string could be
        used for characters.
          Added another parameter to the write callback which points
        to a copy of the unmodified row.  Managing this copy 
        slows the system slightly but the ability to do
        edge detection is worth the extra CPU time.
        The changes in the calling parameters of the write callback
        makes this release incompatible with earlier releases.
          Fixed a bug in selecting which columns to save to disk
        for non-volatile tables.

<tr valign="top"><td><a href=rta-0.7.0.tgz>rta-0.7.0.tgz</td>
<td>2004-01-03<br>
        Added a row 'iterator' to the table definition.  Prior
        to this addition all tables had to be linear arrays
        of structs.  The iterator function makes it possible
        to have linked lists or other more complex data
        structures appear as if they were in a Postgres data
        base.  <br>
          This change modifies the API slightly and this
        version is not backward compatible with earlier
        versions.  We've added two members to the TBLDEF
        structure and the read and write callbacks now
        have a pointer to the row as well as the row number.

<tr valign="top"><td><a href=rta-0.6.2.tgz>rta-0.6.2.tgz</td>
<td>2003-12-16<br>
        Converted from PostgreSQL 7.3 protocol
        to PostgreSQL 7.4 protocol.  Version 0.6.2 is *not*
        compatible with the libraries or tools of PostgreSQL 7.3.
        Changes include removing the BEGIN and COMMIT commands
        and removing the pg_user table since these are no longer
        required for connection set up.  The function command is
        also removed.<br>
           dbcommand() now return RTA_NOBUF if there insufficient
        room in the output buffer for even an error message.

<tr valign="top"><td><a href=rta-0.6.1.tgz>rta-0.6.1.tgz</td>
<td>2003-08-26<br>
        Change st_atim to st_atime in rtafs.c.

2003-08-22<br>
        Added virtual file system interface using
        the fuse package by Miklos Szeredi.  The library librtafs.a
        adds two API routines, rtafs_init() and do_rtafs(), which
        mount and maintain the program's tables as files in a file
        system.<br>
           This version also fixes a memory leak which occurred when
        the Yacc parser detected an SQL syntax error.  The amount of
        leaked memory was about equal to the lengths of the table and
        columns names in the query.

</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><a href=rta-0.5.1.tgz>rta-0.5.1.tgz</td>
<td>2003-04-18 <br>

        Added BEGIN and COMMIT to the SQL commands
        recognized in order to allow login from Posgres 7.3.X clients.
        The 7.3 Postgres login uses a transaction as part of the login.
        The commands, while not causing an error, DO NOTHING.  There
        is no attempt in the code to implement transactions.
